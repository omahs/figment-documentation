The Cosmos Staking flow allows you to stake your ATOM tokens to the validator of your choice on Cosmos.
This way, you are able to stake your ATOM within a few steps and start earning rewards on your staked tokens.

Staking ATOM is a simple process. We will collect:

- The `delegator_address` from which ATOM is being Stakingd, which will sign the transaction.
- The `validator_address` to which ATOM is Stakingd.
- The `amount` of ATOM to be Stakingd.
- An optional `memo`.
- An optional `gas_limit` and `gas_price` in ATOM.

Follow the steps in this guide for the details on this process.
