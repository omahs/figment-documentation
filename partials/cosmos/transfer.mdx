Transferring ATOM is a simple process. We will collect:

- The account from which ATOM to be transferred, which will sign the transaction.
- The address to which ATOM is transferred.
- Amount of ATOM to be transferred.
- An optional memo.
- An optional `gas_limit` and `gas_price`, denominated in ATOM.

Follow the steps in this section for the details on this process.
