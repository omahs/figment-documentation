## ReStaking

The Cosmos ReStaking flow allows you to immediately reStaking the ATOM tokens from Validator X to Validator Y.
This way, you don't need to wait for 21 days to unbond the ATOM tokens and then Staking that stake to another validator.

To reStaking ATOM tokens, you will need:

- The `delegator_address` from which ATOM is being reStakingd, which will sign the transaction.
- The `source_validator_address` from which ATOM is being reStakingd (Validator X).
- The `destination_validator_address` to which ATOM will be reStakingd (Validator Y).
- The `amount` of ATOM to be reStakingd.
- An optional `memo`.
- An optional `gas_limit` and `gas_price` in ATOM.
- The `pubkey` (public key) of the `delegator_address`.

Follow the steps in this guide for the details on this process.
