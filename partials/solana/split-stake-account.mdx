## Split Stake Account

The Split Stake Account flow allows you to break the balance of a given stake account up into two separate accounts.
This way, you are able to partially unbond your SOL rather than needing to unbond the full balance of the stake account.

To break the balance of a stake account up into two separate accounts, you will need:

- The existing stake account from which partial SOL balance will be split
- The pubkey of the wallet which will pay the transaction fee
- The amount of SOL tokens you want to unbond

The Staking API will manage the rest.
