The Aggregated Unstaking flow allows you to unstake ETH from multiple validators at once. There are two ways:

### Option 1: On Demand Exits

This is the way to unstake ETH across multiple validators with a single request.

**There are no transactions to be signed by the customer in this flow** &mdash; Figment will review and manually approve on-demand exits within 24-72 business hours from the time the flow is processed.

A maximum of 100 validators sharing the same withdrawal address can be exited per request.

    },
    {
      name: "Get Aggregated Unstaking Flow Status",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Option 2: Using VoluntaryExits

This is the way to unstake ETH if you have pre-signed exit transactions for the validators you want to exit.

**There are no transactions to be signed by the customer in this flow** &mdash; The `VoluntaryExit` data will be immediately broadcast without a manual approval by Figment.
