The Ethereum Aggregated Staking flow allows you to stake ETH to multiple validators at once. There are two ways:

### Option 1: On Demand Validators (`Recommended`)

To stake ETH as per this method you do not need validators.

<APIReferenceNav
  service="staking-api"
  network="ethereum"
  path="docs/staking/02_networks/ethereum/index.mdx"
  methods={[
    {
      name: "Create New Aggregated Staking Flow",
    },
    {
      name: "Submit Aggregated Staking Data (Option 1: On Demand Validators)",
    },
    {
      name: "Submit Signed Aggregated Deposit Transaction for Broadcast",
    },
    {
      name: "Get Aggregated Staking Flow Status",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Option 2: Bring Your Validators

This is the way to stake ETH if you already have validators.

<APIReferenceNav
  service="staking-api"
  network="ethereum"
  path="docs/staking/02_networks/ethereum/index.mdx"
  methods={[
    {
      name: "Create New Aggregated Staking Flow",
    },
    {
      name: "Submit Aggregated Staking Data (Option 2: Bring Your Validators)",
    },
    {
      name: "Submit Signed Aggregated Deposit Transaction for Broadcast",
    },
    {
      name: "Get Aggregated Staking Flow Status",
    },
  ]}
/>
