## Aggregated Staking

The Ethereum Aggregated Staking flow allows you to stake ETH tokens to multiple validators at once in just a few steps.

Aggregated staking flow allows you to stake ETH in two ways:

### Option 1 (On-demand ETH staking)

It's the recommended way to stake ETH using the Staking API. To stake ETH as per this method you will need:

- `funding_account_address` &mdash; The wallet from which the ETH will originate
- `withdrawal_address` &mdash; The withdrawal address into which you want to receive your ETH after withdrawal.
- `amount` &mdash; The amount of ETH you want to stake. It must be a multiple of 32.

### Option 2 (Bring your validators)

It's the optional way to stake ETH using the Staking API in which you have to manually input the deposits data. To stake ETH as per this method you will need:

- `funding_account_address` &mdash; The wallet from which the ETH will originate
- `deposits` &mdash; Array of validator deposit data:
  - `validator_pub_key` &mdash; The public key of the validator to which the ETH will be deposited
  - `withdrawal_credentials` &mdash; The withdrawal address for the given validator
  - `signature` &mdash; A BLS proof of possession, i.e. a proof that the private key corresponding to the `validator_pub_key` is known by the signer
  - `deposit_data_root` &mdash; Uniquely identifies the set of deposits made so far
  - `genesis_fork_version` &mdash; The fork version of Ethereum you used as an input to create `signature`.
- `gas_limit` &mdash; Adjust the gas limit
- `gas_price` &mdash; Adjust the gas price
