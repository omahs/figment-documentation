## Unstaking

Withdraw your staked ETH from Ethereum's consensus layer using Figment&apos;s Staking API!

To unstake ETH using a pre-signed exit transaction and the Staking API, you will need:

- `validator_index` &mdash; The validator index that your validator was assigned when it joined the beacon chain.
- `epoch` &mdash; A recent epoch during which the validator will exit the active set.
- `signature` &mdash; A BLS signature of the [`VoluntaryExit`](https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/#/Beacon/submitPoolVoluntaryExit) message by the validator&quot;s signing key.

Follow the steps in this guide for the details on this process.

### Flow Diagram

Below is a complete diagram for the Ethereum unstaking flow:

### Notes

:::caution important

- During the transition from `exiting` to `unstaked`,
  hourly checks are performed by the Staking API for up to 28 hours. If hourly checks timeout (by exceeding 28 attempts) the flow state becomes `failed` and a webhook is sent.

For more information on the withdrawal process, refer to Figment&apos;s <Link to="https://www.figment.io/resources/ethereum-withdrawals-a-comprehensive-faq-guide">Ethereum Withdrawals: A Comprehensive FAQ</Link>.
