## Staking

Make a deposit to the Ethereum staking smart contract using this flow in the Staking API!

To stake ETH, you will need:

- `funding_account_address` &mdash; The wallet from which the ETH will originate
- `validator_pub_key` &mdash; The public key of the validator to which the ETH will be deposited
- `withdrawal_credentials` &mdash; The withdrawal address for the given validator
- `signature` &mdash; A BLS proof of possession, i.e. a proof that the private key corresponding to the `validator_pub_key` is known by the signer
- `deposit_data_root` &mdash; Uniquely identifies the set of deposits made so far
- `gas_limit` &mdash; Adjust the gas limit
- `gas_price` &mdash; Adjust the gas price

Follow the steps in this guide for the details on this process.
