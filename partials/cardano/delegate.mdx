## Delegate

Make a delegation to a Cardano staking pool using this flow in the Staking API!

To delegate ADA, you will need:

- `delegator_address` &mdash; The wallet from which the ADA will originate
- `validator_address` &mdash; The validator address to which the ADA will be delegated

Cardano has specific requirements for staking account registration:

- If the delegator has already posted a staking key registration certificate and a delegation certificate for their staking key, the Staking API will create a delegation transaction
- If registration by the delegator is still required, the Staking API can create and broadcast the registration transaction

Follow the steps in this guide for the details on this process.

:::info

Cardano has no unbonding period, any delegated balance is free to be transferred at any time.

Delegation on Cardano differs from other networks, in that the entire balance of the delegator address is delegated, rather than a portion of the balance. Delegating more ADA is just a matter of transferring funds into the delegating wallet, the balance of which will be delegated without further action.

Undelegating ADA only requires transferring that amount out of the delegating wallet.

### Blockfrost Project IDs

:::caution important

Blockfrost Project IDs are a secret. Treat them with caution, following security best practices.

:::

To use Cardano with the Staking API, you must first add a [Blockfrost Project ID](https://blockfrost.dev/docs/overview/getting-started#creating-first-project) to your account using the `/blockfrost_projects` endpoint.
