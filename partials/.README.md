# Partials

This directory is organized by network, and contains markdown files which are imported
by each network's API Reference page.

These files are not generated in the same way as the index pages in `/docs/staking/Networks/[:network]`.

The intent of these files is to make maintenance easier, as changes here do not require changes to the `generate.js` script.

Each network folder contains `overview.mdx` which imports the markdown files pertaining to each flow
for the Staking API.

The files should always be named in `lower-kebab-case`, and the import should always be in `UpperCamelCase`, including the JSX tag, i.e. `import SolanaDelegate from "@site/partials/solana/delegate.mdx";` & `<SolanaDelegate />`.
