# Partials

This directory is organized by network, and contains markdown files which are imported by each network's API Reference page.
These files are not generated in the same way as the index pages in `/docs/staking/02_Networks/[:network]`.

Each network folder contains `overview.mdx` which imports the markdown files pertaining to each flow for the Staking API.
The intent of partials is to make maintenance and updates easier, as changes to these files do not require changes to the `generate.js` script.

The files below the `partials` directory should always be named in `lower-kebab-case` with an `.mdx` file extension, i.e. `claim-rewards.mdx`.

The import should always be in `UpperCamelCase`, i.e. `import SolanaStaking from "@site/partials/solana/staking.mdx";`.

The invocation of the MDX file must be `UpperCamelCase` inside a self-closing tag, i.e. `<SolanaStaking />`.
