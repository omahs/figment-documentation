Claiming MATIC rewards is a simple process. We will collect:

- The address from which MATIC is delegated
- The Validator contract to which they are delegated
- Optionally, the gas limit & gas price to be paid for the claim transaction

:::caution important

The amount of MATIC rewards must be greater than 1.0 MATIC before a Claim Rewards transaction is possible using the Staking API.

Attempts to create a Claim Rewards transaction for a given delegator address when the pending reward balance is below 1.0 MATIC will result in the following validation error:

```json
{
  "code": "invalid",
  "message": "Request could not be processed due to validation errors!",
  "errors": {
    "delegator_address": [
      {
        "code": "reward amount has to be greater than 1.0 MATIC",
        "message": "reward amount has to be greater than 1.0 MATIC",
        "context": {}
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
