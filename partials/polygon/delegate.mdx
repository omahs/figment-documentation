## Delegate

Delegating MATIC tokens happens on the Ethereum network (not the Polygon network), and requires two steps:

1. **Allowance Transaction**: This approves sending a specific amount of MATIC tokens to a staking contract on Ethereum.
2. **Delegation Transaction**: This delegates MATIC to a specific validator via its associated smart contract.

:::info note

Before using this flow, please ensure that your MATIC tokens are on Ethereum mainnet or testnet.
This may require you to withdraw your MATIC tokens _from_ Polygon _to_ Ethereum via the [Polygon bridge](https://wallet.polygon.technology/polygon/bridge/withdraw).

There is a step-by-step guide for the withdrawal process available on the Polygon docs: [https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/develop/wallets/polygon-web-wallet/web-wallet-v3-guide/#step-by-step-guide-2](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/develop/wallets/polygon-web-wallet/web-wallet-v3-guide/#step-by-step-guide-2).

- For `mainnet` the contract address of the MATIC token is `0x7D1AfA7B718fb893dB30A3aBc0Cfc608AaCfeBB0` &mdash; [Etherscan - Mainnet MATIC Token](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7d1afa7b718fb893db30a3abc0cfc608aacfebb0#balances)

- For `testnet` the contract address of the MATIC token is `0x499d11E0b6eAC7c0593d8Fb292DCBbF815Fb29Ae` &mdash; [Etherscan - Testnet MATIC Token](https://goerli.etherscan.io/token/0x499d11E0b6eAC7c0593d8Fb292DCBbF815Fb29Ae#balances)
