## Unstaking

The Staking API's DOT unstaking flow will walk your application through the process of unbonding DOT, and optional processes of chilling and withdrawing. There are a few different routes through this process:

- **Withdraw** from delegated account
- **Unbond** from the delegated account

**Before** unbonding:

- If the user selects the maximum amount and the delegation has active nominators, the account will first be chilled.

**After** unbonding:

- If an unbonded entry does not exist, then it is considered rebonded and we are done
- If there are no funds to withdraw, then it is considered unbonded and we are done
- If there are funds to withdraw, we proceed to withdraw funds and are done

In the following guide we will illustrate the entire flow from chilling to withdrawing.
