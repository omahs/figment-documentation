## Transfer

Transferring DOT is a simple process. We will collect:

- The address from which DOT is transferred.
- The account that will sign the transaction.
- The address to which DOT is transferred.
- Amount of DOT to be transferred.

In the following steps, we will illustrate how to transfer DOT with the Staking API.
