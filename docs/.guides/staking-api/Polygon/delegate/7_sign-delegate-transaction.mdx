Sign the delegate transaction using the `transaction_payload` you received in response to submitting the delegate data.

Locate the `transaction_payload` in the response from the previous step. It will look something like this:

```json
"transaction_payload": "0x02f86e05018459682f00850a82b48cc683039b269415ed57ca28cbebb58d9c6c62f570046bc089bc6680b8446ab150710000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000de0b6b3a76400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000c0"
```

:::caution important

Always confirm the details of the transaction before signing the payload.

Figment has a tool for signing and decoding Staking API payloads, see the guide [Signing Transactions with Figment's NPM Package](/guides/staking-api/figment-signing-transactions) to continue.

Transactions can also be signed using [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-eth-accounts.html#signtransaction) or [Fireblocks](/guides/staking-api/fireblocks-signing-transactions).

Sign the transaction and move on to the next step. A signed transaction payload for Polygon will look something like this:

```text
0x02f8b105018459682f00850a82b48cc683039b269415ed57ca28cbebb58d9c6c62f570046bc089bc6680b8446ab150710000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000de0b6b3a76400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000c001a0d296fcf71df637b5642425980baa23ad635e18d8a321791a015a4458c53e3684a01eb9e8493d106997e66d065aa7a914b297bde333d7376c9f0869ce3d5bdc7388
