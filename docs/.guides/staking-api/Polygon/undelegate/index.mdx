## Introduction

Undelegating MATIC is a simple process. There are two transactions to complete:

1. Unbonding transaction — This starts the unbonding of the specified number of MATIC tokens.
2. Claim transaction — This claims MATIC back into the delegating address once the unbonding period is complete.
