## Step 1 - Make sure Node.js is installed

:::note

If you are installing Node.js on WSL, you can [follow this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-wsl) by Microsoft.

Current and LTS releases of Node.js can be [downloaded from the official site](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

:::

Once the installation is complete, or if you already have Node.js installed, type the command `node -v` inside a terminal window (such as bash, zsh, cmd.exe or PowerShell) to check the currently installed version.

Most modern JavaScript APIs will target Node.js v12+. Using a version manager such as [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm#--fast-node-manager-fnm----) is strongly encouraged, as it allows developers to quickly switch between Node.js versions as needed.

## Step 2 - Initialize the project directory

Enter the following commands into your terminal:

```text
mkdir samplecode
cd samplecode
npm init -y
npm install --save dotenv
```

These commands accomplish the following:

- `mkdir` creates our project directory, the directory name can be changed to anything suitable - it does not need to be `samplecode`.
- The `cd` command changes into the newly created directory (making it the working directory).
- Run the node package manager - `npm` , optionally with the `-y` flag to skip the prompts and generate a default `package.json` (also known as the project manifest).
- Install the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package, which will allow us to access environment variables inside of our JavaScript code.

Assuming no errors during the installation of dotenv, the project directory will now contain these files and directories in the following structure:

```text
+-- /samplecode
    |
    +-- package.json
    |
    +-- package-lock.json
    |
    +-- /node_modules
        |
        +-- /dotenv
```

Since we used the `--save` flag when installing, it will be much easier to see which dependencies are installed by looking inside the `package.json`:

```text title="package.json"
{
  "name": "samplecode",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "dotenv": "^9.0.2"
  }
}
```

If you are unfamiliar with environment variables, please refer to our guide on [dotenv and .env](https://docs.figment.io/network-documentation/extra-guides/dotenv-and-.env) at this point to understand the package and what it is used for.

If you are using the more modern [ES6 `import` syntax](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/js-modules-es6) when developing, we will need
to add a line to the `package.json` in order to prevent a `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module`.

The `import` keyword was introduced in Node.js v12, a language feature to simplify the use of modules. Alternatively, we could use an .mjs file extension for all of our JavaScript files, however adding this line to `package.json` enables us to keep the .js file extension and saves a lot of hassle with configuration:

```json
"type": "module",
```

:::note

If you are using the older, slightly more common `require()` syntax, then it is unnecessary to add this line to `package.json`.

:::

With these steps completed, we now have a project directory that is prepared to have other dependencies installed into it using `npm install`. This basic setup is a sufficient start to be able to write and execute further JavaScript code using Node.js, the next step being to install whichever dependencies we would like to learn about. This is a good way to experiment and become familiar with specific JavaScript libraries.
