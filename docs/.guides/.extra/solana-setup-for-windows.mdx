import Link from "@docusaurus/Link";

The Rust BPF toolchain is _not available_ for Windows.
This means that compiling Solana programs cannot be performed in a Windows development environment. The following software is required to set up and complete the **Solana** Pathway on a computer running the Microsoft Windows operating system:

- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.figment.io/network-documentation/extra-guides/docker-setup-for-windows)
- [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#manual-installation-steps)

:::note

We recommend using [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) to consume the interactive content of learn-web3-dapp rather than setting up WSL - however this guide is still useful in the event you must use a Windows machine to compile using the BPF toolchain.

The Solana Pathway is available on GitHub at the [learn-web3-dapp repository](https://github.com/figment-networks/learn-web3-dapp).

## Install Docker Desktop

Follow our guide on <Link to="/guides/extra/docker-setup-for-windows">Docker Setup for Windows</Link>.

## Install WSL on Windows

Windows 10 Home machines must meet the following requirements to install Docker Desktop:

- Install Windows 10, version 1903 or higher.&#x20;
- The following **hardware** prerequisites are required to successfully run WSL2 on Windows 10 Home:
  - 64 bit processor with [Second Level Address Translation (SLAT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Level_Address_Translation)
  - 4GB system RAM
  - BIOS-level hardware virtualization support must be enabled in the BIOS settings. For more information, refer to the [Virtualization](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/troubleshoot/#virtualization) troubleshooting topic.
- Enable the WSL2 feature on Windows. For detailed instructions, refer to the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
- Download and install the [Linux kernel update package](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/wsl2-kernel).

## **Setup the Solana ecosystem**

To access the filesystem of your [installed Linux distribution](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#step-6---install-your-linux-distribution-of-choice) for WSL :

- Run the command [`wsl`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/reference) from a `cmd.exe` or PowerShell terminal. Once you have logged in, install the [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) with the command: `sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.7.11/install)"`
- It is also important to make sure your PATH in the WSL environment includes the location of the Solana release you have installed, such as `:PATH="~/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"`
- More information on viewing and setting the PATH in Linux is [available here](https://opensource.com/article/17/6/set-path-linux).

Once WSL is installed and you can access it through the Windows command prompt, you can continue to follow the [setup instructions for the Rust toolchain](https://learn.figment.io/tutorials/deploy-solana-program#set-up-the-solana-c-l-i) in the Solana Pathway. This will enable you to compile Solana programs on a computer running Microsoft Windows, within the WSL environment.

Happy building! üòÅ
