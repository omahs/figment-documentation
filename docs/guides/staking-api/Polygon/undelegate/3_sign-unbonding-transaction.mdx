Sign the unbonding transaction using the `transaction_payload` you received in response to submitting the unbonding data.

Locate the `transaction_payload` in the response from the previous step. It will look something like this:

```json
"transaction_payload": "0x02f86d05028459682f0084597a1b168304cf969415ed57ca28cbebb58d9c6c62f570046bc089bc6680b844c83ec04d0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000de0b6b3a76400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000de0b6b3a7640000c0"
```

:::caution important

Always confirm the details of the transaction before signing the payload.

Figment has a tool for signing and decoding Staking API payloads, see the guide [Signing Transactions with Figment's NPM Package](/guides/staking-api/figment-signing-transactions) to continue.

:::

Transactions can also be signed using [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-eth-accounts.html#signtransaction) or [Fireblocks](/guides/staking-api/fireblocks-signing-transactions).

Sign the transaction and move on to the next step. A signed transaction payload for Polygon will look something like this:

```text
0x02f8b005028459682f0084597a1b168304cf969415ed57ca28cbebb58d9c6c62f570046bc089bc6680b844c83ec04d0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000de0b6b3a76400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000de0b6b3a7640000c001a0f8462149f25c9942852611ea06820bf0b3f588f63aead9702225010b2e80a096a0765feade968806e16f36cadf533d779ceb071f54ca6cf4935f6464302c0873da
