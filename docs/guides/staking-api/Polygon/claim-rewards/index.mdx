## Introduction

Claiming MATIC rewards is a simple process. We will collect:

- The address from which MATIC is delegated
- The Validator contract to which they are delegated
- Optionally, the gas limit & gas price to be paid for the claim transaction

:::info note

The amount of MATIC rewards must be greater than 1.0 MATIC before a Claim Rewards transaction is possible.
