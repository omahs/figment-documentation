Sign the claim transaction using the `transaction_payload` you received in response to submitting the claim rewards data.

Locate the `transaction_payload` in the response from the previous step. It will look something like this -

```json
"transaction_payload": "0x02f84c05038459682f00849b6d87fe830278519415ed57ca28cbebb58d9c6c62f570046bc089bc6680a4e97fddc20000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001c0"
```

:::caution important

Always confirm the details of the transaction before signing the payload.

Figment has a tool for signing and decoding Staking API payloads, see the guide [Signing Transactions with Figment's NPM Package](/guides/staking-api/figment-signing-transactions) to continue.

:::

Transactions can also be signed using [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-eth-accounts.html#signtransaction) or [Fireblocks](/guides/staking-api/fireblocks-signing-transactions).

Sign the transaction and move on to the next step. A signed transaction payload for Polygon will look something like this:

```text
0x02f88f05038459682f00849b6d87fe830278519415ed57ca28cbebb58d9c6c62f570046bc089bc6680a4e97fddc20000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001c001a0818e02361da6e36a7d0093d385d1f13b0c5e539126023f8a4175ab1a375d0723a0571fabd4f32c978e1b17585f4df52d667ca9bd824204f43db0805a291c635c46
