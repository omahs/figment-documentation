Sign the delegate transaction using the `transaction_payload` you received in response to submitting the delegate data.

Locate the `transaction_payload` in the response from the previous step. It will look something like this:

```json
"transaction_payload": "0x02f86d05018459682f0084598840d28303d2e19415ed57ca28cbebb58d9c6c62f570046bc089bc6680b8446ab150710000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000de0b6b3a76400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000c0"
```

:::caution important

Always confirm the details of the transaction before signing the payload.

Figment has a tool for signing and decoding Staking API payloads, see the guide [Signing Transactions with Figment's NPM Package](/guides/staking-api/figment-signing-transactions) to continue.

Transactions can also be signed using [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-eth-accounts.html#signtransaction) or [Fireblocks](/guides/staking-api/fireblocks-signing-transactions).

Sign the transaction and move on to the next step. A signed transaction payload for Polygon will look something like this:

```text
0x02f8b005018459682f0084598840d28303d2e19415ed57ca28cbebb58d9c6c62f570046bc089bc6680b8446ab150710000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000de0b6b3a76400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000c001a0424cfeb222e8dda2207cfa4e3958e252c9d5b79af6ca9e356a9f736a1de31483a03d0d9acc2cec2dca7569bdfaaf29e598a61faf7ce488de658e9af354c0d21c1b
