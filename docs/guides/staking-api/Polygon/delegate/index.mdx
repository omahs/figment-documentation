Delegating MATIC tokens happens on the Ethereum network (not the Polygon network), and requires two steps:

1. **Allowance Transaction**: This approves sending a specific amount of MATIC tokens to a staking contract on Ethereum.
2. **Delegation Transaction**: This delegates MATIC to a specific validator via its associated smart contract.
