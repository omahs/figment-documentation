title: Submit Delegate Transaction Data
---

Now that the allowance is in place, submit a delegation transaction to delegate the MATIC.
The previous response indicates two required `inputs`:

```json
{
  "gas_limit": "[:gas_limit]",
  "gas_price": "[:gas_price]"
}
```

```bash title="Example cURL request"
curl --request PUT \
  --url https://slate.figment.io/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next \
  --header 'Authorization: API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "create_delegate_tx",
  "inputs": {
    "gas_limit": "[:gas_limit]",
    "gas_price": "[:gas_price]"
  }
}'
```

:::info note

In this response you can find the unsigned, serialized transaction in `data[create_delegate_tx][raw]`.

:::

There are two possible `actions`:

- `refresh_delegate_tx` — If you need to get a fresh version of the transaction Payload.
- `sign_delegate_tx` — Submit a signed transaction Payload ready to be broadcast to the network.

We will chose `sign_delegate_tx``, so note that it indicates one Input to collect:

- `transaction_payload` (**required**) — the signed transaction payload ready to be broadcast to the network.
