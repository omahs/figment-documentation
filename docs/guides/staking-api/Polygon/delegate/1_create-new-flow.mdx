title: Create New Delegation Flow
---

We will create a new Flow with `POST /api/v1/flows`.

The `flow` JSON field for this request will be:

```json
{
  "network_code": "polygon",
  "chain_code": "testnet",
  "operation": "staking",
  "version": "v1"
}
```

```bash title="Example cURL request"
curl -X POST https://polygon-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows \
-H "Authorization: API-KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "flow": {
    "network_code": "polygon",
    "chain_code": "testnet",
    "operation": "staking",
    "version": "v1"
  }
}'
```

The response indicates one possible action:

- `assign_staking_data` - provide the funding address, validator contract address, and amount of tokens to be staked. The Staking API will check on-chain to determine if an allowance transaction is needed.

The `assign_staking_data` action indicates five fields for data collection:

- `delegator_address` (**required**) — the main wallet MATIC will be originating from.
- `validator_address` (**required**) — the address of the validator smart contract associated with the validator you wish to delegate to.
- `amount` (**required**) — the number of MATIC tokens to be delegated.
- `minimum_shares_to_mint` (_optional_) — the minimum number of shares of the delegation pool to be minted. If the exchange rate results in fewer shares being minted, the transaction will fail.
- `max_slippage_percentage` (_optional_) — the maximum slippage you are willing to accept.
