title: Submit a Signed Delegate Transaction for Broadcast
---

After signing the transaction, you will `PUT /api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` and the Staking API will manage broadcasting the transaction to the network.

At this step, the `inputs` JSON will be:

```json
{
  "transaction_payload": "[:signed_transaction_payload]"
}
```

```bash title="Example cURL request"
  curl --request PUT \
  --url https://polygon-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next \
  --header 'Authorization: API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "sign_delegate_tx",
  "inputs": {
    "transaction_payload": "[:signed_transaction_payload]"
  }
}'
```

## Delegation Flow Complete!

Congratulations, your stake is now active and earning rewards!
