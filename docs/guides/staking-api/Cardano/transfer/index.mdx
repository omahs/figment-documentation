## Introduction

Transferring ADA is a simple process. We will collect:

- The account from which ADA to be transferred, which will sign the transaction.
- The address to which ADA is transferred.
- Amount of ADA to be transferred.

Follow the steps in this section for the details on this process.

#### Blockfrost Project IDs

To use Cardano with the Staking API, you must first add a [Blockfrost Project ID](https://blockfrost.dev/docs/overview/getting-started#creating-first-project) to your account using the `/blockfrost_projects` endpoint, which is detailed in the [API Reference](https://docs.figment.io/api-reference/staking-api/cardano#post%20/api/v1/blockfrost_projects).

:::caution important

Blockfrost Project IDs are a secret. Treat them with caution, following the same security [best practices](https://docs.figment.io/guides/manage-and-secure-api-keys#api-key-best-practices) as with an API key.
