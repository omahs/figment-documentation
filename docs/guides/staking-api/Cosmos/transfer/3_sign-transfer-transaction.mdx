Sign the transfer transaction using the `transaction_payload` you received in response to submitting the transfer data.

Locate the `transaction_payload` in the response from the previous step. It will look something like this:

```json
"transaction_payload": "TODO paste a cosmos payload here"
```

:::caution important

Always confirm the details of the transaction before signing the payload.

Figment has a tool for signing and decoding Staking API payloads, see the guide [Signing Transactions with Figment's npm Package](/guides/staking-api/figment-signing-transactions) to continue.

:::

Sign the transaction and move on to the next step. A signed transaction payload for Cosmos will look something like this:

```text
TODO paste a signed cosmos payload here
```
