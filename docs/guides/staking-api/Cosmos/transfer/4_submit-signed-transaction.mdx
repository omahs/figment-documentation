title: Submit Signed Transfer Transaction for Broadcast
slug: /guides/staking-api/cosmos/transfer/submit-signed-transaction
---

After signing the transaction, send a `PUT` request to `/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` with the signed payload. The Staking API will broadcast the transaction to the network.

### Parameters

- `name` &mdash; `string` Name of the action to execute (required). `sign_transfer_tx` in this case.
- `inputs` &mdash; `array`
  - `transaction_payload` &mdash; Signed transaction payload from the previous step's response.

#### Sample cURL Request

```bash {5-8}
curl -X PUT 'https://cosmos-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows/:flow_id/next' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR-BEARER-TOKEN' \
-d '{
  "name": "sign_transfer_tx",
  "inputs": {
    "transaction_payload": "TODO paste signed payload here"
  }
}'
```

### Response

With the signed transaction provided, the Staking API will broadcast it to the network. As the transaction progresses towards confirmation, the returned state will be either:

- `transfer_tx_broadcasting` &mdash; Transaction has been broadcast and is waiting confirmation.
- `completed` &mdash; Transaction has been confirmed and the transfer is complete.
