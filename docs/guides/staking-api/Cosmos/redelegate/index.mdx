## Introduction

The Cosmos Redelegate flow allows you to immediately redelegate the ATOM tokens from Validator X to Validator Y.
This way, you don't need to wait for 21 days to unbond the ATOM tokens and then delegate that stake to another validator.

To redelegate ATOM tokens, you will need:

- The `delegator_address` from which ATOM is being redelegated, which will sign the transaction.
- The `source_validator_address` from which ATOM is being redelegated (Validator X).
- The `destination_validator_address` to which ATOM will be redelegated (Validator Y).
- The `amount` of ATOM to be redelegated.
- An optional `memo`.
- An optional `gas_limit` and `gas_price` in ATOM.
- The `pubkey` (public key) of the `delegator_address`.

Follow the steps in this guide for the details on this process.
