The Ethereum Aggregated Staking flow allows you to stake ETH tokens to multiple validators at once in just a few steps.

To stake ETH with aggregated staking flow, you will need:

- `funding_account_address` &mdash; The wallet from which the ETH will originate.
- `validator_pub_key` &mdash; The public key of the validator to which the ETH will be deposited.
- `withdrawal_credentials` &mdash; The withdrawal address for the given validator.
- `signature` &mdash; A BLS proof of possession, i.e. a proof that the private key corresponding to the `validator_pub_key` is known by the signer.
- `deposit_data_root` &mdash; Uniquely identifies the set of deposits made so far.
- `gas_limit` &mdash; Adjust the gas limit.
- `gas_price` &mdash; Adjust the gas price.

Follow the steps in this section for the details on this process.
