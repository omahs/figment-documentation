The Merge Stake Account flow allows you to merge two stake accounts that have the same authorities and lockup, into a single stake account. A merge is possible between two stakes in the following states with no additional conditions:

- Two deactivated stakes
- An inactive stake into an activating stake during its activation epoch

For the following cases, the voter pubkey and vote credits observed must match:

- Two activated stakes
- Two activating accounts that share an activation epoch, during the activation epoch

All other combinations of stake states will fail to merge, including all "transient" states, where a stake is activating or deactivating with a non-zero effective stake. For more details check [Solana docs](https://docs.solana.com/staking/stake-accounts#merging-stake-accounts).

To merge two separate stake accounts into one, you will need:

- `destination_stake_account_pubkey` - Public key of the stake account in which you want to merge the another stake account.
- `source_stake_account_pubkey` - Public key of the stake account which you want to merge with the another stake account.
- `funding_account_pubkey` - The pubkey of the wallet which will pay the transaction fee

The Staking API will manage the rest.
