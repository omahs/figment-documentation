title: Create New Delegation Flow
slug: /guides/staking-api/solana/delegate/create-new-flow
---

To initiate the staking process, create a new flow with a `POST` request to `/api/v1/flows`.

### Parameters

- `flow` &mdash; `object`
  - `network_code` &mdash; `string` Network this flow operates on (ex. `solana`) (required).
  - `chain_code` &mdash; `string` Chain this flow operates on (ex. `testnet`) (required).
  - `operation` `string` The operation to perform (ex. `staking`) (required).
  - `version` &mdash; `string` API version to use (ex. `v1`) (optional).

#### Sample cURL Request

```bash {5-10}
curl -X POST 'https://solana-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: <api_key>' \
-d '{
  "flow": {
    "network_code": "solana",
    "chain_code": "testnet",
    "operation": "staking",
    "version": "v1"
  }
}'
```

### Response

- `id` &mdash; `string` ID of the newly created flow.
- `state` &mdash; `string` The current state of the flow.

The response indicates two possible `actions`:

- `assign_stake_account` &mdash; Use this action if you already have an inactive stake account you want to activate.
- `create_new_stake_account` &mdash; Use this action if you do not have an inactive stake account and want to create a new one.

Since we want to create a new stake account, we will use the second action. The `create_new_stake_account` action indicates four fields for data collection:

- `funding_account_pubkey` &mdash; The main wallet your SOL will be originating from.
- `stake_authority_pubkey` &mdash; Grants authority to sign certain staking relation transactions to the provided address. Defaults to `funding_account_pubkey`.
- `withdraw_authority_pubkey` &mdash; Grants authority to sign certain withdrawal related transactions to the provided address. Defaults to `funding_account_pubkey`.
- `amount` &mdash; The amount of SOL to be sent to the stake account. This field should be in full SOL, not in lamports (i.e. if you want to stake 5 SOL, return `"amount": 5.0`). The Staking API will translate the amount to lamports so you do not have to worry about the conversion factor. Lamports are fractional SOLs.
