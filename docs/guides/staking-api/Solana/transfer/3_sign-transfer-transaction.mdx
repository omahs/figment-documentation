:::warning important

The transaction signing window on Solana is sometimes less than 90 seconds.

If you encounter an error `"Transaction simulation failed: Blockhash not found"`, refresh the transaction, sign the payload again and submit it in < 90 seconds.

:::

Sign the transfer transaction using the `transaction_payload` you received in response to submitting the transfer data.

Locate the `transaction_payload` in the response from the previous step. It will look something like this:

```json
"transaction_payload": "010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001000103f8c4898641adada76eeeee2de872d931bc58bfb2ce5b79734e32808cc501a5347fdda76b682402ecb38e705b77d7eee793c587b6294a461c14ad89e7e161ade500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000008a20e5a91435e4f72d11db3e291b4797b6830cd2187f94596bca768ca81a5dff01020200010c0200000000ca9a3b00000000"
```

:::caution important

Always confirm the details of the transaction before signing the payload.

Figment has a tool for signing and decoding Staking API payloads, see the guide [Signing Transactions with Figment's NPM Package](/guides/staking-api/figment-signing-transactions) to continue.

:::

Transactions can also be signed using the [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/offline-signing#:~:text=Typically%20a%20Solana%20transaction%20must,the%20extra%20time%20you%20need) or [Fireblocks](/guides/staking-api/fireblocks-signing-transactions).

Sign the transaction and move on to the next step. A signed transaction payload for Solana will look something like this:
