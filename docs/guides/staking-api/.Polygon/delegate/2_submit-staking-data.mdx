title: Submit Staking Data
---

After collecting the required Inputs, we `PUT /api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` to move on to the next step.
In this case, the `inputs` JSON would be:

```json
{
  "delegator_address": "[:delegator_address]",
  "validator_address": "[:validator_address]",
  "amount": "[:amount]"
}
```

```bash title="Example cURL request"
curl -X PUT https://polygon-slate.figment.io/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next \
  --header 'Authorization: API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "assign_staking_data",
  "inputs": {
    "delegator_address": "[:delegator_address]",
    "validator_address": "[:validator_address]",
    "amount": "[:amount]"
  }
}'
```

In the response received from the Staking API we see one possible `actions` :

- If an allowance transaction is needed, `create_allowance_tx`
- Otherwise, if no further allowance is needed, `create_delegate_tx`

Assuming an allowance is needed we will proceed with `create_allowance_transaction` which indicates two optional Inputs to collect:

- `gas_limit` (_optional_) - The gas limit for the transaction.
- `gas_price` (_optional_) - The highest gas price you will pay for the transaction.
