title: Submit a Signed Transaction for Broadcast
---

After signing the transaction, you will `PUT /api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` and the Staking API will manage broadcasting the transaction to the network.

At this step, the `inputs` will be:

```json
{
  "transaction_payload": "[:signed_transaction_payload]"
}
```

```bash title="Example cURL request"
curl --request PUT \
  --url https://polygon-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next \
  --header 'Authorization: API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "sign_undelegate_tx",
  "inputs": {
    "transaction_payload": "[:signed_transaction_payload]",
    "signatures": []
  }
}'
```

With the signed transaction provided, the Staking API will broadcast it to the network.
As the transaction progresses towards confirmation, the returned state will be one of:

- `unbond_tx_broadcasting` — the transaction has been broadcast and is waiting for confirmation
- `unbonding` — the transaction has been confirmed and the delegation is unbonding
