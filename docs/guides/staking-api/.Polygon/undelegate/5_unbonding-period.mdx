title: Unbonding Period
---

Polygon has an unbonding period of approximately 2 days. During this time, the un-delegated MATIC will be illiquid and will not earn rewards.

You can find the expected unbonding completion time in the response you received after submitting the signed un-delegate transaction.
Once the unbonding period ends, the un-delegated MATIC will be added to the available for withdrawal balance of the delegating address.
You will then need to submit a claim transaction to bring those MATIC into the delegating address' liquid balance.

The `create_claim_tx` action indicates two fields for data collection:

- `gas_limit` (_optional_) — Adjust the gas limit for the transaction
- `gas_price` (_optional_) — Adjust the gas price for the transaction
