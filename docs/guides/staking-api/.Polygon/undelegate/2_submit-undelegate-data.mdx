title: Submit Un-Delegate Data
---

After collecting the required inputs, we `PUT /api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` to move on to the next step.  
In this case, the `inputs` JSON would be:

```json
{
  "validator_address": "[:validator_address]",
  "delegator_address": "[:delegator_address]",
  "amount": "[:amount]"
}
```

```bash title="Example cURL request"
curl -X PUT https://polygon-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next \
  --header 'Authorization: API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "create_undelegate_tx",
  "inputs": {
    "validator_address": "[:validator_address]",
    "delegator_address": "[:delegator_address]",
    "amount": "[:amount]"
  }
}'
```

We see two possible `actions`:

- `refresh_undelegate_tx` — If you need to get a fresh version of the transaction payload (for example, if the nonce needs to be updated)
- `sign_undelegate_tx` — Submit a signed transaction payload ready to be broadcast to the network

We will choose `sign_undelegate_tx`, which indicates one input to collect:

- `transaction_payload` (**required**) — the signed transaction payload ready to be broadcast to the network.
