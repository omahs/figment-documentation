## Motivation

A webhook is an HTTP request which triggers by an event in a source system (ex. Figment's Staking API) and sent to a destination system (ex. Cloudflare Worker) with a payload of data. In general, webhooks are a way to send automated messages between systems whenever a new event takes place.

The Staking API uses webhooks to send notifications about events related to the various Staking API flows.
For example, when an undelegation flow is completed, a webhook can be sent to the server of your choosing. Read more about the different [event types](#event-types) below.

There are some security considerations when dealing with webhooks.
This guide provides all the information needed to successfully manage webhooks in the context of Figment's Staking API.

We will examine how serverless functions (Cloudflare Workers) can be beneficial to this process, and provide example code which can be used as the basis for your own solution.

## Event Types

Staking API Webhook events can be categorized by type, specific to a network code and operation.
The event type format follows the pattern **`<network_code>.<operation>.<action>.<specifier>`**.

Event types are standardized in that:

- When a transaction is confirmed on-chain, there will be a `.confirmed` event &mdash; ex. `near.staking.delegation.confirmed`

- If a transaction fails on-chain, there will be an `.error` event &mdash; ex. `near.staking.delegation.error`

- For staking flows, whenever there is a waiting period involved the Staking API will send a `delegation.activating` event &mdash; ex. `near.staking.delegation.activating`

- When the waiting period is finished, the Staking API will send a `delegation.active` event &mdash; ex. `near.staking.delegation.active`

- Similarly, for unstaking flows the Staking API sends the `delegation.deactivating` event, followed by `delegation.inactive`

- If there is a withdrawal action required after unstaking, the Staking API also sends a `delegation.ready_for_withdrawal` event

### Usage

Consumers of Staking API webhooks can subscribe to events with wildcards (`*`), or by specifying a complete event type without a wildcard:

- `"event_types": ["*"]` subscribes to all webhook events, regardless of network
- `"event_types": ["near.*"]` subscribes to all webhook events for NEAR flows
- `"event_types": ["near.staking.*"]` subscribes to all webhook events for NEAR `staking` flows
- `"event_types": ["near.staking.delegation.confirmed"]` subscribes to confirmation events for NEAR `staking` flows

```json {3} title="Example response from /webhook_endpoints"

  "enabled": true,

  "secret": "whsec_B8sidV4Bm8NnstMuP3a9TSGYov..."
}
```

The above example webhook ID number 16 would send a payload to the `target_url` for any NEAR transfer flow event, provided that `enabled` is set to true.

Verify the contents of webhook payloads using the HMAC signature that is sent as a response header from the Staking API. This is illustrated in the following section.

The fields which are common to all Staking API webhook payloads are `flow_id` and `event_type`. All other fields will be relevant to the action and flow.

```bash {4-5} title="Example Staking API Webhook Payload"
{
  amount: '10.0',
  status: 'success',
  flow_id: '49a1bab1-e3e6-4f77-8212-ee254e1ab9a3',
  event_type: 'near.transfer.transfer_tx.confirmed',
  transaction_hash: '2a9fnT6j5M9Fy6TFNbX2bA1Ncjh6aXK9Ky8oPBUuJwtS',

  from_account_address: 'staking-api-demo.testnet'
}
```

## HMAC

HMAC (**Hash-based Message Authentication Code**) is a cryptographic authentication technique which uses a shared secret and a hash function such as SHA-256.

When you create a webhook endpoint with the Staking API, the response will include a `secret` beginning with `whsec_`.
This is the shared secret you will use to verify future payloads sent to that webhook endpoint.

Learn more about the specifics of HMAC in the <Link to="#references">References</Link> section.

:::caution important

Code examples are provided as samples only and should not be used in production out of the box. **Use at your own risk.**

Here are some code examples for verifying the HMAC signatures:

<Tabs><TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
const crypto = require("crypto").webcrypto;
const TOLERANCE = 300;
const WH_SECRET = "<your webhook secret>";

export default async function verifySignature(header, body) {
  // get the time from the header
  const timestamp = header.match(/t=([^,\s*]+)/)[1];

  // get all signatures in Unit8Array format
  const signatures = [...header.matchAll(/v\d+=([^,\s*]+)/g)].map((match) => {
    return new Uint8Array(Math.ceil(match[1].length / 2)).map((v, i) =>
      parseInt(match[1].substr(i * 2, 2), 16)
    );
  });

  // init text encoder
  const encoder = new TextEncoder();

  // construct the cyptographic key
  const key = await crypto.subtle.importKey(
    "raw",
    encoder.encode(WH_SECRET),
    { name: "HMAC", hash: "SHA-256" },
    false,
    ["verify"]
  );

  // verify that at least one signature is valid
  const verified = (
    await Promise.all(
      signatures.map(async (signature) => {
        return await crypto.subtle.verify(
          "HMAC",
          key,
          signature,
          encoder.encode(`${timestamp}.${body}`)
        );
      })
    )
  ).includes(true);

  // check if elapsed timestamp is within tolerance
  const elapsed = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) - Number(timestamp);
  const withinTolerance = !(TOLERANCE && elapsed > TOLERANCE);

  // return validity
  return verified && withinTolerance;
}
```

    return True
```

</TabItem></Tabs>

## Signatures

Webhooks from the Staking API are sent with the `Slate-Signature` header, which you can use to verify the payload.
The value of that header will look like this:

```text
t=1666214090,v1=f790a584722ff6c0ebf4e9b59835ba5b93ee824ae0a7164feba30953d6b52cee
```

- `t` is a UNIX Epoch timestamp.
- `v1` is the signature. Each additional signature will increment the value of `v` &mdash; `v2`, `v3`, etc.

## Cloudflare Worker Setup

Cloudflare Workers provide flexibility and scalability when handling webhooks.
We can use a Cloudflare Worker to capture, inspect, and manage a webhook response payload from the Staking API.
Refer to the steps outlined in the guide <Link to="/guides/proxy-requests#create-a-cloudflare-service-worker">Proxy Requests to Figment APIs</Link> if you need to create a new Cloudflare Service Worker.

You will need to set up two environment variables in the Cloudflare dashboard:

- `WH_SECRET`, set the value to the `secret` provided when you created a webhook endpoint.
- `TOLERANCE`, a number of seconds (a value of 300 is recommended). An inbound signature is considered stale if older than the tolerance.

### Usage

Use the example code we've provided here to implement your own solution.

The `verifySignature` function uses the <Link to="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/web-crypto/">Web Crypto API</Link> to verify that the incoming webhook payload was signed by the Staking API.

If your particular language and server implementation specifies a character encoding, ensure that you handle the payload as a UTF-8 encoded string.
JSON is encoded as UTF-8 by default.

```js
"use strict";

addEventListener("fetch", function (event) {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event));
});

async function verifySignature(header, body) {
  // Get the time from the header
  const timestamp = header.match(/t=([^,\s*]+)/)[1];

  // Get all signatures in Uint8Array format
  const signatures = [...header.matchAll(/v\d+=([^,\s*]+)/g)].map((match) => {
    return new Uint8Array(Math.ceil(match[1].length / 2)).map((v, i) =>
      parseInt(match[1].substr(i * 2, 2), 16)
    );
  });

  // Instantiate a TextEncoder
  // Takes a string as input, returns a Uint8Array containing UTF-8 encoded text.
  const encoder = new TextEncoder();

  // Construct the key using the Web Crypto API
  // WH_SECRET must be set as a Cloudflare environment variable
  const key = await crypto.subtle.importKey(
    "raw",
    encoder.encode(WH_SECRET),
    { name: "HMAC", hash: "SHA-256" },
    false,
    ["verify"]
  );

  // Verify that at least one signature is valid
  const verified = (
    await Promise.all(
      signatures.map(async (signature) => {
        return await crypto.subtle.verify(
          "HMAC",
          key,
          signature,
          encoder.encode(`${timestamp}.${body}`)
        );
      })
    )
  ).includes(true);

  // Check if elapsed timestamp is within tolerance
  const elapsed = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) - Number(timestamp);
  const withinTolerance = !(TOLERANCE && elapsed > TOLERANCE);

  // Return validity
  return verified && withinTolerance;
}

async function handleRequest(event) {
  // Verify the inbound webhook payload
  const header = event.request.headers.get("Slate-Signature");
  const body = await event.request.text();
  const verified = await verifySignature(header, body);

  // If not verified, exit early with a red herring 200 response
  if (!verified) {
    console.log("signature failed");
    return new Response("", { status: 200 });
  }

  // Do your work, handle side-effects/events here
  const data = JSON.parse(body);
  console.log("signature verified");
  console.log(data);

  // Exit gracefully
  return new Response("", { status: 200 });
}
//# sourceMappingURL=index.js.map
```

</details>

:::caution important

When you create a webhook endpoint with the Staking API, the `target_url` should point to a URL which can handle incoming webhooks, whether that is a Service Worker as outlined above, or a custom solution.
