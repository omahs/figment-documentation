title: Sign the Deposit Transaction
---

After successfully submiting the delegation data, in reasponse you have received the `transaction_payload`, you'll be using this `transaction_payload` to sign the transaction for delegation.

`transaction_payload` look something like this -

```bash
"transaction_payload": "12000000736c6174652d64656d6f2e746573746e657400415d57cdf21d28e35e0cfa864e895c18b4bc6a711642d38eb6762af81ec1cf3904cc1038fc5700001600000030316e6f64652e706f6f6c2e663836333937332e6d309ab9d36f31580c94fcf7eace07f4a286a6f69cdd3caef0efed5d78930df546880100000002110000006465706f7369745f616e645f7374616b65020000007b7d00e057eb481b0000000000b9340332b7f4ad140000000000"
```

You can sign transaction using the [NearJS API](https://docs.near.org/integrator/create-transactions#create-sign--send-transaction), [Fireblocks](/guides/staking-api/fireblocks-signing-transactions) OR [@figmentio/slate npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@figmentio/slate).

To know how to sign the transaction with [@figmentio/slate npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@figmentio/slate) please check out this guide [HERE](/guides).

Once you sign the transaction successfully you'll get the signed transaction payload in response which you'll need in next step so make sure to copy/save it.

Signed transaction payload will look something like this -

```bash
12000000736c6174652d64656d6f2e746573746e657400415d57cdf21d28e35e0cfa864e895c18b4bc6a711642d38eb6762af81ec1cf3904cc1038fc5700001600000030316e6f64652e706f6f6c2e663836333937332e6d309ab9d36f31580c94fcf7eace07f4a286a6f69cdd3caef0efed5d78930df546880100000002110000006465706f7369745f616e645f7374616b65020000007b7d00e057eb481b0000000000b9340332b7f4ad14000000000000cd7538bc1db22a72cbaa19f54e9df00b9444863c74eefd5897d2ebbb7a52e7f8042d675c09d40684b7f7dd17feb73ecd09f6ae08c33e7f82450b438694f5430e
```

This part is all on you! Get that transaction signed and move on to the next step.

:::caution important

At this point, it is best practice to always confirm the details of the transaction, which can be done using our provided [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@figmentio/slate) or CLI tool.
