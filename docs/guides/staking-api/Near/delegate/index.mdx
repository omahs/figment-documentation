Delegating NEAR is a simple process. We will collect:

- The delegating address
- The signing public key
- The validator address
- The amount of NEAR to be staked
- Optionally, a max gas amount (upper limit of the transaction fee to be paid)

Once the delegating transaction is confirmed on-chain, the delegation will immediately be active and earning staking rewards.
