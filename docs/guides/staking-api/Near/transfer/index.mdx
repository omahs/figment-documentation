## Introduction

Transferring NEAR is a simple process. We will collect:

- The address from which NEAR is transferred
- The account that will sign the transaction
- The address to which NEAR is transferred
- Amount of NEAR to be transferred

Once the transfer transaction is confirmed on-chain, the transfer of NEAR between accounts is complete.
