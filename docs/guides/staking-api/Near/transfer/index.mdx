Transferring NEAR is a simple process. We will collect:

- The address from which NEAR is transferred.
- The account that will sign the transaction.
- The address to which NEAR is transferred.
- Amount of NEAR to be transferred.

Once the transfer transaction is confirmed on-chain, the transfer of NEAR between accounts is complete.
