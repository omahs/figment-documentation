title: Sign the Deposit Transaction
---

After successfully submiting the deposit data, in reasponse you have received the `transaction_payload`, you'll be using this `transaction_payload` to sign the transaction for transfer.

`transaction_payload` look something like this -

```bash
"transaction_payload": "12000000736c6174652d64656d6f2e746573746e657400415d57cdf21d28e35e0cfa864e895c18b4bc6a711642d38eb6762af81ec1cf3906cc1038fc5700000d00000070697a7a612e746573746e657490121aa419ea5a902edec74ac78626fd251b8466f4c637f3ded5f0898014448001000000030000004a480114169545080000000000"
```

Figment has a tool for signing and decoding payloads, see the guide [HERE](/guides/staking-api/figment-signing-transactions) to continue.

OR you can sign transaction using the [NearJS API](https://docs.near.org/integrator/create-transactions#create-sign--send-transaction) or [Fireblocks](/guides/staking-api/fireblocks-signing-transactions).

Once you sign the transaction successfully you'll get the signed transaction payload in response which you'll need in next step so make sure to copy/save it.

Signed transaction payload will look something like this -

```bash
12000000736c6174652d64656d6f2e746573746e657400415d57cdf21d28e35e0cfa864e895c18b4bc6a711642d38eb6762af81ec1cf3906cc1038fc5700000d00000070697a7a612e746573746e657490121aa419ea5a902edec74ac78626fd251b8466f4c637f3ded5f0898014448001000000030000004a48011416954508000000000000e7a0bf4947796c6c2962084dccd3c97fa1b78de1fab4765ab3d2cadf3e6c90b6290d5aae0a79b7c0a5bc31120210591135a7604fcc12ecc4b3b34d7513e73a0b
```

This part is all on you! Get that transaction signed and move on to the next step.

:::caution important

At this point, it is best practice to always confirm the details of the transaction, which can be done using our provided [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@figmentio/slate) or CLI tool.
