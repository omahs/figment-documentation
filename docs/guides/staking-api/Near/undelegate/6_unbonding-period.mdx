title: Unbonding Period
---

NEAR has an unbonding period of approximately 2-4 days. During this time, the un-delegated NEAR will be illiquid and will not earn rewards.

You can find the expected unbonding completion time in the response you received in Step 4 after submitting the signed un-delegate transaction.

Once the unbonding period ends, the un-delegated NEAR will be added to the available for withdrawal balance of the delegating address.

You will then need to submit a withdrawal transaction to bring those NEAR into the delegating address' liquid balance.

The `create_withdraw_tx` action indicates five fields for data collection:

- `delegator_address` — The delegator address
- `delegator_pubkey` — The pubkey of the signing account
- `validator_address` — Validator address from which LUNA will be un-delegated
- `withdraw_amount` — the amount of NEAR to be withdrawn
- `withdraw_maximum` — Set to true if you wish to withdraw the full available balance without needing to know the exact available balance.
- `max_gas` — Adjust if you wish to limit the possible transaction fee
