title: Sign the Un-Delegate Transaction
---

After successfully submiting the un-delegation data, in reasponse you have received the `transaction_payload`, you'll be using this `transaction_payload` to sign the transaction for un-delegation.

`transaction_payload` look something like this -

```bash
"transaction_payload": "12000000736c6174652d64656d6f2e746573746e657400415d57cdf21d28e35e0cfa864e895c18b4bc6a711642d38eb6762af81ec1cf3905cc1038fc5700001600000030316e6f64652e706f6f6c2e663836333937332e6d308e0f6b6bb5b283186516419e2d4c06a47f7d55b456b83947fb5f8fb815957df6010000000207000000756e7374616b65270000007b22616d6f756e74223a223235303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030227d00e057eb481b000000000000000000000000000000000000"
```

Figment has a tool for signing and decoding payloads, see the guide [HERE](/guides/staking-api/figment-signing-transactions) to continue.

OR you can sign transaction using the [NearJS API](https://docs.near.org/integrator/create-transactions#create-sign--send-transaction) or [Fireblocks](/guides/staking-api/fireblocks-signing-transactions).

Once you sign the transaction successfully you'll get the signed transaction payload in response which you'll need in next step so make sure to copy/save it.

Signed transaction payload will look something like this -

```bash
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
```

This part is all on you! Get that transaction signed and move on to the next step.

:::caution important

At this point, it is best practice to always confirm the details of the transaction, which can be done using our provided [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@figmentio/slate) or CLI tool.
