---

After successfully submiting the withdraw data, in reasponse you have received the `transaction_payload`, you'll be using this `transaction_payload` to sign the transaction for withdraw.

`transaction_payload` look something like this -

```bash
"transaction_payload": "12000000736c6174652d64656d6f2e746573746e657400415d57cdf21d28e35e0cfa864e895c18b4bc6a711642d38eb6762af81ec1cf3907cc1038fc5700001600000030316e6f64652e706f6f6c2e663836333937332e6d3084edd29289b3a590be582317bb0061016a8df058b7c29a0278f5b82f86c283010100000002080000007769746864726177270000007b22616d6f756e74223a223235303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030227d00e057eb481b000000000000000000000000000000000000"
```

You can sign transaction using the [NearJS API](https://docs.near.org/integrator/create-transactions#create-sign--send-transaction), [Fireblocks](/guides/staking-api/fireblocks-signing-transactions) OR [@figmentio/slate npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@figmentio/slate).

To know how to sign the transaction with [@figmentio/slate npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@figmentio/slate) please check out this guide [HERE](/guides).

Once you sign the transaction successfully you'll get the signed transaction payload in response which you'll need in next step so make sure to copy/save it.

Signed transaction payload will look something like this -

```bash
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
