Undelegating NEAR is a simple process. We will collect:

- The delegating address.
- The signing address.
- The validator address to undelegate from.
- Amount of NEAR to be undelegated.
- Optionally, a `maximum` Boolean if you wish to undelegate the full amount without having to check the current balance.
- Optionally, a max gas amount (upper limit of the transaction fee to be paid).

Once the undelegation transaction is confirmed on-chain, the unbonding process will begin immediately.

NEAR has an unbonding period of four epochs (â‰ˆ 48-60h). During this time, the unbonding NEAR will be illiquid and will _not_ earn rewards.
Upon completion of the unbonding period, the NEAR will be available to be withdrawn.

If you have a balance waiting to be withdrawn and do not wish to undelegate more NEAR, you can use the `create_withdraw_tx` action to withdraw from that balance without first unbonding any NEAR.
