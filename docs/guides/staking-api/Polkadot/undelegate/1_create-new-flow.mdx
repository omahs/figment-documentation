title: Create New Undelegation Flow
slug: /guides/staking-api/polkadot/undelegate/create-new-flow
---

To initiate the undelegation process, create a new flow with a `POST` request to `/api/v1/flows`.

:::info

**If chilling is required** before unbonding, the Staking API will indicate that you must create a chill transaction. Proceed to [Create Chill Transaction](/guides/staking-api/polkadot/undelegate/create-unbond-transaction).

**If no chilling is required**, you will be presented with an action to create the unbond transaction. Proceed to [Create Unbond Transaction](/guides/staking-api/polkadot/undelegate/create-unbond-transaction).

If you want to skip the unbonding process as well, proceed to [Create Withdrawal Transaction](/guides/staking-api/polkadot/undelegate/create-withdraw-transaction).

From a newly initialized flow you can either jump right to `create_withdraw_tx` or perform `assign_unstaking_data`.

If you assign the unstaking data, you may need to create, sign, and broadcast a chill transaction, followed by an unbonding transaction.

After unbonding, you can either be done with the flow, or if there is a balance to withdraw, you can create, sign, and broadcast the withdraw transaction.

### Parameters

- `flow` &mdash; `object`
  - `network_code` &mdash; `string` Network this flow operates on (ex. `polkadot`) (required).
  - `chain_code` &mdash; `string` Chain this flow operates on (ex. `westend`) (required).
  - `operation` `string` The operation to perform (ex. `unstaking`) (required).
  - `version` &mdash; `string` API version to use (ex. `v1`) (optional).

#### Sample cURL Request

```bash {5-10}
curl -X POST 'https://polkadot-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: <api_key>' \
-d '{
  "flow": {
    "network_code": "polkadot",
    "chain_code": "westend",
    "operation": "unstaking",
    "version": "v1"
  }
}'
```

### Response

- `id` &mdash; `string` ID of the newly created flow.
- `state` &mdash; `string` The current state of the flow.

The response indicates two possible `actions`:

- `assign_unstaking_data` &mdash; Use this action if you want to unbond. Chill first if needed. Optionally used to withdraw.
- `create_withdraw_tx` &mdash; Use this action if you want to withdraw _without_ unbonding.

The `assign_unstaking_data` action indicates 5 fields for data collection:

- `stash_account_address` &mdash; The wallet DOT is bonded to.
- `controller_account_address` &mdash; The account that controls the staking/unstaking actions. This is the account that will sign transactions.
- `controller_proxy_account_address` (optional) â€” A proxy account that can sign on behalf of the controller account.
- `amount` &mdash; The amount of DOT to be unbonded from the controller. This field should be in full DOT, not in Planck (i.e., if you want to stake 5 DOT, return `"amount": 5.0`). The Staking API will translate the amount to Plancks so you do not have to worry about the conversion factor.
- `maximum` &mdash; This boolean indicates if all bonded funds should be unbonded.
