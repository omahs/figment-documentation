After successfully submitting the withdraw transaction data, in reasponse you have received the `transaction_payload`, you'll be using this `transaction_payload` to sign the transaction for confirmation.

`transaction_payload` look something like this:

```json
"transaction_payload": "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"

Figment has a tool for signing and decoding payloads, see the guide [HERE](/guides/staking-api/figment-signing-transactions) to continue.

OR you can sign transaction using the [Polkadot JS Tools](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-transaction-construction) or [Fireblocks](/guides/staking-api/fireblocks-signing-transactions).

Once you sign the transaction successfully you'll get the signed transaction payload in response which you'll need in next step so make sure to copy/save it.

Signed transaction payload will look something like this:

```bash
0xb1018400beaa875b14abaeae2d1a55193ba6f175aa846b7e624dce1514fbf043638aa858012e6b1b07390a44705bc2630166187e6e1f0e35616dd51b09a9b4ca9549978237c5ecf39161c3764b06ff8dd79e261ee2b39df4a49d604766519f01e9eecbab85002400060300000000
```

This part is all on you! Get that transaction signed and move on to the next step.

:::caution important

Always confirm the details of the transaction, which can be done using our provided [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@figmentio/slate) or CLI tool.
