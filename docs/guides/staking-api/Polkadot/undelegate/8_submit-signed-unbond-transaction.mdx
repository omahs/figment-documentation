title: Submit Signed Unbond Transaction for Broadcast
slug: /guides/staking-api/polkadot/undelegate/submit-signed-unbond-transaction
---

After signing the transaction, you will `PUT /api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` and the Staking API will manage broadcasting the transaction to the Polkadot network.

### Parameters

- `name` &mdash; `string` Name of the action to execute (required).
- `inputs` &mdash; `array`
  - `transaction_payload` &mdash; Signed transaction payload from the previous step's response.

#### Sample cURL Request

```bash {5-8}
curl -X PUT 'https://polkadot-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows/86d4a5d4-1c75-4c6a-926d-ab930e57f504/next' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: <api_key>' \
-d '{
  "name": "sign_unbond_tx",
	"inputs": {
    "transaction_payload": "0xb9018400beaa875b14abaeae2d1a55193ba6f175aa846b7e624dce1514fbf043638aa85801ac450cfe75472d098ead17ad661c282f65fabd0547359ced7118c3962b1aba5b6a23f2cd84aa3f09df44811a0ae9cf144be73aec333105e2f18bcdfd00a1e9840018000602070010a5d4e8"
  }
}'
```

### Response

With the signed transaction provided, Staking API will broadcast it to the network. As the transaction progresses towards confirmation, the returned state will be `unbond_tx_broadcasting`.

Upon transaction finalization, the unbond will be complete and you can move on to one of the three next steps:

- If the unbonded entry _does not_ exist in the era, then it is considered `rebonded` and it moves into the `done` state.
- If the unbonded entry _does_ exist and there are no funds to withdraw, it is considered unbonded and it moves into the `done` state.
- If the unbonded entry _does_ exist and there are funds to withdraw, it moves into the `ready_to_withdraw` state. We will see two possible actions:
  - `create_withdraw_tx` &mdash; This proceeds with withdrawing from the account.
  - `complete` &mdash; This will end the flow if we do not want to withdraw funds.
