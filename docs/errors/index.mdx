Figment uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

In general: Codes in the <code>2xx</code> range indicate success. Codes in the <code>4xx</code> range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a staking transaction failed, etc.). Codes in the <code>5xx</code> range indicate an error with Figment's servers.

## HTTP Response Status Codes

| Code    | Message               | Meaning                                                                                                                                                     |
| :------ | :-------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **200** | OK                    | The request succeeded.                                                                                                                                      |
| **400** | Bad Request           | The server cannot or will not process the request due to some client error like incorrect request syntax.                                                   |
| **401** | Unauthorized          | The client must authenticate itself to get the request response, this can occur due to an incorrect API Key or Auth token.                                  |
| **403** | Forbidden             | The client doesn't have access rights to the content/service.                                                                                               |
| **404** | Not Found             | The server can not find the requested resource. Coming from an API, it can also mean that the endpoint is correct but the requested resource doesn't exist. |
| **405** | Method Not Allowed    | The request method is known by the server but is not supported by the target resource.                                                                      |
| **408** | Request Timeout       | A timeout means the server shut down the connection.                                                                                                        |
| **429** | Too Many Requests     | The user has exceeded their quota or sent too many requests in a given timeframe, and is subject to rate limiting.                                          |
| **500** | Internal Server Error | The server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle.                                                                                      |
| **501** | Not Implemented       | The request method is not supported by the server and cannot be handled.                                                                                    |
| **502** | Bad Gateway           | This error response means that the server, while acting as a gateway, tried to handle the request and got an invalid response.                              |
| **503** | Service Unavailable   | The server is not ready to handle the request. Common causes are a server that is down for maintenance or that is overloaded.                               |
| **504** | Gateway Timeout       | This error response is given when the server is acting as a gateway and cannot get a response in time.                                                      |

## JSON-RPC Error Codes

:::info

Error result fields will contain the following information:

1. `code` - A Number that indicates the error type that occurred, (ex. `-32600`).
2. `message` - A String providing a short description of the error.
3. `data` - A Primitive or Structured value that contains additional information about the error. This may be omitted.
